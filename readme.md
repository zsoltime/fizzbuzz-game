# Day 3 of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

This is the third day of my [3 weeks challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge), bringing you a really simple FizzBuzz game.

Unlike the normal counting game, in this FizzBuzz you should "guess" if the number shown is a multiple of 3 (Fizz), a multiple of 5 (Buzz), a multiple of both 3 and 5 (FizzBuzz) or none of these.

## User Stories

- [x] There are certain levels and the game is getting more and more difficult by reaching higher levels
- [x] I have lives, so I can make a few mistakes
- [x] There is a countdown timer
- [x] I get a score based on the time and correct answers
- [x] I can see my best score
- [ ] I can share my result(s) on Twitter

## Next Steps

Although I kinda liked to build this game, the code looks like a mess. I didn't have enough time to refactor it and to add a Twitter button.

I also wanted to reward the user with some extra points if they reach higher levels.
